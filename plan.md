## Steps for plan

[x] Decide the game
[x] Plan your project (what images do you need)
[x] Define MVP (minimal viable product/project) - that will be defined by the requirements
[x] Define what the extras are and how to prioritise them
[x] Create the folder structure
[x] Create the files
[x] Start coding

## Steps for MVP

[x] Logic for starting game
[x] Creating main character
[x] How does the main character move?
[x] What makes the animation look the way it does? (setInterval() or requestAnimationFrame())
[x] Obstacle behaviour
[] Collision
[] Logic for losing or winning

A playable game, that has an objective for the user, and a win/lose outcome.

## Plan

[x] Create the game board (full screen, mobile, etc.)
[x] Make the player appear on the screen
[x] Create the logic for the player to move
[x] Make the player move with arrow keys
[x] Create an obstacle
[x] Move the obstacle
[] Create multiple obstacles?
[] Create the collision logic
[] Possible extra: Making objects appear randomly
[] Possible extra: Limit player movement to the play screen
[] Possible extra: Change player from block to an image
