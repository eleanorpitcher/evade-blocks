## Steps for plan

1. Decide the game
2. Plan your project (what images do you need)
3. Define MVP (minimal viable product/project) - that will be defined by the requirements
4. Define what the extras are and how to prioritise them
5. Create the folder structure
6. Create the files
7. Start coding

## Steps for MVP

1. Logic for starting game
2. Creating main character
3. How does the main character move?
4. What makes the animation look the way it does? (setInterval() or requestAnimationFrame())
5. Obstacle behaviour
6. Collision
7. Logic for losing or winning

A playable game, that has an objective for the user, and a win/lose outcome.

## Plan

1. Create the game board (full screen, mobile, etc.)
2. Make the player appear on the screen
3. Create the logic for the player to move
4. Make the player move with arrow keys
5. Create an obstacle
6. Move the obstacle
7. Create multiple obstacles?
8. Create the collision logic
9. Possible extra: Making objects appear randomly
10. Possible extra: Limit player movement to the play screen
11. Possible extra: Change player from block to an image
